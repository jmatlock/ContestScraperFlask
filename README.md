# ContestScraperFlask
Flask Server and REST API for Instructables Contest info

This project scrapes the Instructables Contest web page for information on the current contests. This data is then made available to local devices 
via a locally run Flask Server which provides a JSON Web API appropriate for CircuitPython devices.

Data provided includes:
- Contest name
- Contest deadline
- (TBD) URI for the specific contest
- (TBD) URI/Graphic for the specific contest sized down as appropriate for small screens
